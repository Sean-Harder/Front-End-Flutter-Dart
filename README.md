I am going to be updating anyone reading this on my progress on learning Dart using flutter, I am currently working on taking my #API_Light_Project that is currently posted on my GitHub and am trying to build and locally host it on my phone. 

There will be different week files
Each file with have what was done in it

I worked on it a few more weeks but then switched to Swift
